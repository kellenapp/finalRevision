# finalRevision
A final project for ENGCMP 0610
I wanted to add another graphic to my portfolio and I served on the Pitt4Shapiro group here so I thought it would be a good opportunity to make a graphic for that. I know he already won but just pretend it's still october 2022. 
All of the assets are free to use license, except the image of Josh which I got from his website and I believe since the graphic is in support of him and his cause it is technically okay to use.
